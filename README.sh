"""
Trimmed reads ran with Snakefile:
The snakemake pipeline takes the trimmed files and performs the follwing steps:
  QC: FastQC and MultiQC
  Align reads to a reference genome (hg38) with STAR aligner Mapping 1 (M1) & Mapping 2 (M2)
  Sort and index bam files for both M1 & M2
  Quantification of reads with featureCounts for M1 & M2
  Transcription assembly and quantification for M1
  Convert bam files to BigWig files for M1 & M2

Directory structure to run snakemake pipeline; the Snakefile is suppose to be in the same directory as the data and bin directories.
Example:
  projectdir/

        Snakefile

        config.yaml

        GTF annotation file

        data/

        bin/


A file named config.yaml is created by the user, and the file has to include a list called
 "samples" with the names of the fastq sample files used, as shown below.
#config.yaml
samples: ["sample_1.fastq", "sample_2.fastq", "sample_3.fastq"]

The output files from the Snakemake pipeline are countmatrixes of .csv files, .bw and .bam files.
The .csv file can be used for DEA, the .bw files are uploaded to the UCSC genome browser and the bam files are used for the COMPSRA program to get countmatrix.
